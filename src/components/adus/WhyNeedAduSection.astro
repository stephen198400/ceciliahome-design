            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              To meet today's alternative family arrangements, you need safe alternative housing options. ADUs make great in-law quarters and provide families with a place to care for their aging parents. ADUs are also a popular way to give adult children a place to live while respecting their privacy.

            <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              If your family relies on an on-site caregiver – like a live-in nurse or nanny – an ADU will give them the privacy and independence they need, while also giving you the on-site convenience you are looking for.

              Accessory Dwelling Units are the perfect fit for short- and long-term rentals. If you live in a popular community, you can Airbnb your ADU and get additional rental income. Or, you may choose to live in your ADU and rent out your main residence to short- or long-term tenants.
